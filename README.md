# Superlista

This repository contains a web application developed using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) process. The application is a to-do list that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. It is designed to run on an Azure Ubuntu web server and incorporates user authentication using email. However, users can also utilize the app without logging in. The project is still under development and serves as a demonstration of the skills and knowledge acquired through the [Obey The Testing Goat-kirjaan](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/) book. The app is accessible at [superlista.online], but please note that the server is not running by default. However, I am happy to start the server for you to experience the app firsthand. The project is still under development.

The following technologies and concepts were employed in the development of this project: Python, Django, Azure, Ubuntu, Nginx, Gunicorn, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
