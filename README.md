# Superlista

This repository contains a web application developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The application is a to-do list that helps users efficiently manage their tasks. It is designed to run on an Azure Ubuntu web server and incorporates email-based user authentication. However, users can also use the app without logging in. Lists can be shared among logged-in users.

The project serves as a demonstration of the skills and knowledge acquired through the [Test-Driven Development with Python](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/) book. The app is accessible at [superlista.online](superlista.online), but please note that the server is not running by default. However, I am happy to start the server for you to experience the app firsthand.

The following technologies and concepts were employed in the development of this project: Python, Django, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Azure, Ubuntu, Nginx, Gunicorn, CI, Jenkins, TDD and Fabric.
