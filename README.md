# Superlista

This repository contains a web application developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The application is a to-do list that helps users efficiently manage their tasks. It was designed to run on an Azure Ubuntu web server and incorporates email-based user authentication. However, users can also use the app without logging in. Lists can be shared among logged-in users.

The project serves as a demonstration of the skills and knowledge acquired through the [Test-Driven Development with Python](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/) book.
